I entered the [#metaverse](www.google.com/search?q=metaverse "metaverse") to explore the [node_modules](https://www.npmjs.com "node_modules") folder:

- Day 1:
I still have the entrance light behind me, 
it's full of folders and some even seem to have the same name.

- Day 2:
I ended up in an example folder of a decommissioned package 3 years ago,
looking at the examples expressed in cave paintings in the cavernous depths of the package. Artistically mediocre, functionally even harmful.

- Day 3:
the exploration seems to go on forever,
I found about thirty packages that do almost all the same thing,
it must be a spontaneous twin formation given by npm's entropic activity.

- Day 4:
there is a package to transpile the code,
but it doesn't do it without other packages above
that do the same thing but for different years.
There is a great noise of water, perhaps I am near a spring of problems.

- Day 5:
maybe there are life forms,
they are the types for the packages seen before,
at the sight of a transpiler icon they escape or deform into incomprehensible things. The word any causes them to blush and throw them into a daze.

- Day 6:
I found pre-Mesolithic libraries, some contain Jquery wrappers.
Phase in which the developers were moving towards the use of frameworks
made by companies created in garages of 80k per square meter.

- Day 7:
my impression is that this training is in continuous expansion,
perhaps the philosopher draws from the illegal urban planning of southern Rome.

- Day 8:
it no longer makes sense to go out,I too dig a hole,
put a name in it and from now on I will be IsOdd.
I create types and parasitically add myself to the application, 
I will live forever and replicate myself.
Others like me, before me.
